  "risk_level_1": "0-29 - GREEN or LOW indicates established history of low risk. Transaction history of queried address exhibits no known unusual activity beyond the normal risk of future exposure to known hacking activities, known viruses, or other malicious activity.",
  "risk_level_2": "30-50 - BLUE or GUARDED indicates a guarded risk of illicit activity. The potential exists for hacking, known viruses, or other malicious cyber activity, but no such activities have been identified - or - where exploits have been identified no significant impact on the associated addresses has occurred.",
  "risk_level_3": "51-79 - ORANGE or ELEVATED indicates an elevated risk of illicit activity. At this level, the potential for exposure to illicit activity is elevated, or indirect exposure has occurred, but no direct exploitation has been observed.",
  "risk_level_4": "80-100 - RED or SEVERE indicates an established history of past illicit activity and cybercrime engagement. At this level, addresses have been actively involved in illegal action, and are highly likely to see future involvement."
